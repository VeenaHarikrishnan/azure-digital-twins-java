# Azure Digital Twins (2018) - Java support collection

This project has been developed for the Azure Digital Twins (2018) version and is discontinued.

Azure Digital Twins (2018) is retiring on **31 December 2020.** A new version of Azure Digital Twins is available in General Availability and provides new updates that weren't available in the previous version such as:

- Flexible modelling and general graph topology
- Richer Compute
- Bring your own IoT Hub for easier integration
- Improved scalability

We recommend removing any Azure Digital Twins (2018) resources that are no longer being used and transitioning to the new service as soon as possible, **as Azure Digital Twins (2018)** **resources will no longer be available for use by end of year 2020**.

The new Azure Digital Twins provides the capabilities that this project covered originally for Azure Digital Twins (2018).

Please reference the [Azure Digital Twins documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/overview-differences) for transitioning into new services.
